 * validate that relationship, never added. Codex reports cache writes, but no
 * cost, so `cacheWrite` is measured while `notionalUsd: 0` means absent, not
 * free. `calls` counts completed command/MCP tools; Codex exposes no AGY-like

/**
 * Decode Codex's NDJSON stream without mistaking tool/progress items for the

 * vocabulary and a future frame must not fail a turn that published.
 * A Codex turn that spent subscription money and produced a reply must reach
 * the organization: uncertainty about accounting degrades to `usage:
 * undefined` and never discards publishable text. Unlike AGY's stricter
 * envelope, Codex may omit, repeat, or follow `turn.completed` with another
 * frame, so only exactly one completion frame supplies trustworthy usage.
 *
 * Success is decided from the terminal frame, not from whether a reply was
 * published: `engineDispatcher.ts`'s runtime envelope tells every agent its
 * terminal response is a private note to the runtime, not an outward
 * message, and that it may "leave it empty". A `turn.completed` with no
 * `agent_message` is therefore a sanctioned silent success — `text: ""`,
 * never a thrown failure — and its usage still reaches the ledger exactly as
 * a spoken turn's would; do not reinstate throwing on empty text, it would
 * both misreport a clean turn as failed and drop its usage from the ledger
 * silently. Only `turn.failed` with no reply already published, or a stream
 * with neither terminal frame at all (a truncated or killed child), reject
 * the turn; the latter gets its own detail string so a genuinely truncated
 * stream is never confused with a legitimately silent one.
