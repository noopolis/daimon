/**
 * Token accounting for one AGY turn, as the engine itself reported it.
 *
 * Same shape and the same discipline as {@link import("./grokHeadlessResult.js").GrokTurnUsage},
 * but AGY's envelope is *not* Grok's. Field provenance is the terminal frame of
 * `agy --print … --output-format stream-json`:
 *
 *     {"event":"result","result":{ "status":"SUCCESS", "response":"…",
 *       "num_turns":1,
 *       "usage":{"input_tokens":…, "output_tokens":…,
 *                "thinking_tokens":…, "cache_read_tokens":…, "total_tokens":…}}}
 *
 * Differences from Grok that this decoder exists to get right:
 *
 * - the prompt-side cache bucket is `cache_read_tokens`, **not**
 *   `cache_read_input_tokens`;
 * - there is no `cache_creation_input_tokens` bucket at all, so `cacheWrite` is
 *   structurally absent and recorded as `0` — absent, not measured-as-zero;
 * - there is no `total_cost_usd`, so `notionalUsd` is `0` for the same reason;
 * - `thinking_tokens` has no Grok equivalent and is a **subset** of
 *   `output_tokens`, not a disjoint bucket. The captured plain turn is
 *   `input 13,722 + output 74 = 13,796 = total_tokens` with
 *   `thinking_tokens: 73`, so adding it would double-count reasoning tokens.
 *   It is therefore read only to be ignored;
 * - AGY supplies its own `total_tokens`, which is cross-checked rather than
 *   trusted (see {@link decodeAgyTurnUsage});
 * - `status: "SUCCESS"` replaces Grok's `subtype`/`is_error` pair.
 *
 * The terminal frame's `usage` is the sum over the turn's model steps, not the
 * last step's: the captured tool turn sums three `step_update` frames
 * (14,579 + 15,079 + 15,279 input) into `input_tokens: 44,937`. Reading a
 * `step_update` would under-report every tool-using wake.

/**
 * Extract per-turn usage from the terminal `result` frame.
 *
 * Advisory: a malformed or absent usage block yields `undefined` rather than
 * failing a turn that published correctly, and never throws.
 *
 * `complete` follows exactly the honesty rule the Grok decoder states: AGY's
 * envelope has no marker for incomplete or absent usage either, so an all-zero
 * block reads as "unknown", not "free". It cannot catch a *partially*
 * zero-filled turn, so every count this decoder produces is a lower bound.
 *
 * AGY additionally reports its own `total_tokens`. Neither side is trusted
 * blindly: the derived sum `input + cacheRead + output` is compared against it,
 * `total` is the larger of the two so a reconciliation failure can never
 * under-report, and any disagreement clears `complete` so the record is
 * rendered as an incomplete turn rather than a verified count. A `total_tokens`
 * that is not a non-negative safe integer rejects the block outright, because
 * an unreadable total is a total that cannot be reconciled.
