/**

 * the usage ledger: the only surviving trace of the 743,024 tokens it burned
 * was the number interpolated into `Codex wake exceeded its 600000-token
 * per-wake ceiling`. Every other failure mode — wall clock, killed child,
 * non-zero exit after `turn.completed` — lost the spend entirely, so an
 * organization's cost total undercounted by however much its failures cost
 * and by an amount nothing could reconstruct.
 *
 * These tests fix the boundary at the only defensible place: usage reaches the
 * ledger exactly when Codex reported it, and never otherwise.
